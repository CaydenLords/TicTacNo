# Overview

A simple tic-tac-toe program written to practice some basic game creation skills. 

To play the game, press numbers 1-9 on the number pad to select the corrosponding space. You can also use the numbers on the keyboard,
but obviously they won't match up with the grid. After choosing the space you want, press enter. Take turns doing this until a player wins. 
If the board is filled, the game will close as well. 

The goal of this program was to get used to PyArcade, as I want to have at least basic proficiency in most game engines. 
While PyArcade isn't the most robust engine, it does have a simplicity to it that makes it useful.

# Development Environment

Programmed in Visual Studio Code with Python. I used the Arcade Library.

# Future Work
If I come back to this project, I'd like to use more class-focused programming to hopefully cut back on the amount of unnecessary code. I'd also like to figure out how to use collision, as it was suprisingly difficult to get working.
